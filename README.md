Results

Breast cancer remains a significant health challenge worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to assess their performance in predicting breast cancer diagnoses, ultimately aiming to improve detection methods.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.

Key Features:
diagnosis: Diagnosis of breast cancer (M = malignant, B = benign)
Other numerical features related to the tumor characteristics
Models Evaluated
The following classifiers were implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Gaussian Naive Bayes

Results
The analysis demonstrated an overall accuracy of 96%, with detailed comparisons and visualizations of each modelâ€™s performance provided in the notebook.
