## Introduction
Breast cancer remains a significant health challenge worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to assess their performance in predicting breast cancer diagnoses, ultimately aiming to improve detection methods.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

### Key Features:
- `diagnosis`: Diagnosis of breast cancer (M = malignant, B = benign)
- Other numerical features related to the tumor characteristics

## Models Evaluated
The following classifiers were implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Results
The analysis demonstrated an overall accuracy of **96%**, with detailed comparisons and visualizations of each modelâ€™s performance provided in the notebook.
